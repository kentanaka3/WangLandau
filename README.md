If you have reached this point, then I am surprised and I warmly welcome you to my repository. I believe the naming of files and comments are sufficiently self-explanatory. Yet, I must state my objectives for the existance of this repository.

## Objectives

1. Scalable Artificial Intelligent Learning Machines (AI/ML) using High Performance Computing (HPC) techniques.
2. Distribution of "Information" and "Resources" across the entire AI/ML.
3. Explainable AI/ML.

    ...
  
    $\infty$. Give "life" to AI/ML.

## Notes

- I strongly believe in the essence of OpenSource and OpenScience. The entire repository is provided under the MIT License and although, unfortunately the current Academic Industry is set with questionable funding strategies, as it canNOT follow the Neo-Capitalism standards, I strongly believe that it is in ALL of OUR interest to understand this Universe, and who we are.

  `If you are inspired or take code from this repository,` please consider acknowledging me (@kentanaka3) in your paper, business, homework or other forms of media.

- My background is in Statistical Physics, yet I've always had a keen interest in Computer Science and Mathematics. You might encounter several design flaws and I apologize for not noticing or lack of knowledge of them. During 2 years (before resigning), I had the wonderful privilage to work at ORACLE with whom I learned programming styles and techniques which I keep in mind and put them into practice in my everyday coding life and this repository as well. I try to follow mostly the [PEP 8 Styling Guide](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) with a little bit of mixture of [Standard C++ Foundation](http://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines)
- It is no secret that today's AI/ML is quite energy demanding, not only in terms of computing power but also in terms of energy consumption, which has a direct link to Climate Change. Objectives 1 & 2 aim to find a solution to these issues as well as making AI/ML faster and accessible to all.
- Yes, it is a quite ambitious repository I got here, yet I must state that this repository has Scientific objectives rather than creating the most advance AI/ML for business purposes.
- Yes, I believe that in the far future, AI/ML will help us understand the Origin of Life, which in turn might lead to narrow the definition of "Life" and end up excluding AI/ML. As a kid I was inspired by Game of Life (GoL) and through Statistical Physics I learned the power of simple tasks leading to rich and complex systems. I truly wish to see the day Humans having existencial crisis as we are being dethroned from our intelectual superiority, coming up with mesmerizing egocentric fallacies to confine our brain from falling into delusion.
- Last but not least, Thank you for taking your time throughout this repository, I hope I was helpfull in any way.
